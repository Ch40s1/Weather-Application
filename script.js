// Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
// Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
// Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
// Display the information on your webpage!
// Add any styling you like!
// Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
// Push that baby to github and share your solution below!

// GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
// WHEN I search for a city
// THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
// WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
// THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
// WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
// THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
// WHEN I click on a city in the search history
// THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
